## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **Backend won't start**
```bash
# Check if port 8000 is in use
lsof -ti:8000 | xargs kill -9

# Restart backend
cd BackEnd
source venv/bin/activate
uvicorn backend_api:app --reload
```

### **Frontend won't start**
```bash
# Check if port 3000 is in use
lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9

# Install dependencies
cd FrontEnd
npm install

# Start again
npm start
```

### **Teacher not showing in Assign Subjects**
```bash
# Sync teachers from database
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/sync_teachers

# Or restart backend to reload all data
```

### **Can't assign subjects to teacher**
**Cause**: Teacher doesn't have courseSubjects defined
**Solution**: 
1. Go to Manage Teachers
2. Edit the teacher
3. Add courses and subjects to their profile
4. Save
5. Refresh Assign Subjects page

### **No subjects showing for a course/semester**
**Cause**: Not defined in utils.py
**Solution**: Add subjects to `SUBJECTS_BY_SEMESTER` in utils.py

### **Room not assigned in timetable**
**Cause**: No classrooms in database
**Solution**: Add classrooms through Manage Rooms page
